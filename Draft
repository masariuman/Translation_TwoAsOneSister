If possible, I would’ve wanted for Ciel to take a break after defeating the one-eyed giant. But since the smell of blood might attract other monsters, I need Ciel to move away from here immediately.
With people being crushed this much, they probably won’t think that Ciel is still alive. However, there are still some things I want to do.

『Now, what shall we do with this fallen giant?』
「I think just leaving it here is fine, but am I wrong?」
『If they ever find this corpse by some chance, they might suspect the existence of survivors.
     The monsters and animals of this forest might make short work of it before that happens, but it’s better if we do something about it. Burning and burying it should do well enough.』
「Understood. “Faro (O fire)”……」
『Ciel, stop.』

After halting Ciel when she immediately prepared to burn it with sorcery, Ciel pursed her lips and looked at me with a questioning look.
As someone that’s considered more or less to be an adult in age, Ciel’s honest obedience felt dazzling to me. If it was me, I would’ve been defensive and say「You’re the one that told me to burn it!」at the very least.
Well, enough of that. Let me try out something that I was a bit curious about.

『Ciel; do you think that you can, perhaps, stab a knife into its body?』
「I don’t really think that we still need to confirm if it’s dead.
     Or is there perhaps another reason for that?」
『Probably somewhere near where a person’s heart is, I can feel a concentration of magic power.』
「So, slice it open and see what it is, right? As for the knife……」
『Let’s try looking for one. It’s likely that the pig man or his company has one on them, after all.』
「Pig man? …… Oh, I’ve never seen a real pig before, but he certainly looked like one! Still, Ain can talk like that too, huh.」

I ended up calling him as I named him in my thoughts. Still, I couldn’t think of a better name for him and Ciel even understands who I’m referring to, so it’s probably fine.
I didn’t want Ciel to be disappointed in my attitude, but after seeing her chuckling in amusement instead, it seems like it was just needless worry from me.
I really don’t want to bring along any of the squished people’s items as much as possible, so we rummaged through the remains of the smashed wagons and immediately found a knife. It was a gaudy knife that had exaggerated ornaments, but it’s probably usable, still.

There was also money as well. It’s the first time I’ve seen it, but as they were small heavy silver and gold discs, I’m likely not mistaken.
There’s nothing to lose in bringing them, so we decided to bring as much as we could.
And while we were at it, I’ve also instructed Ciel to search for a hooded robe or mantle.
Since Ciel’s long white hair might stand out, I wanted something that could hide it. Since the bangs were a nuisance, Ciel haphazardly — though I did watch and give some instructions — used sorcery to cut it. We practically left the hair on her back untouched, so it’s grown up until her waist.

There’s no problem with the length, but the fact that it changed color from being originally blond is what’s worrying me. If it’s a common hair color to have in this world, then it’s fine; but if white is rare or doesn’t exist at all, it’s very likely that it could get us into trouble.
Still, even without her hair color, Ciel already has a lot of traits that would get her into trouble.

The robe is for hiding her hair as well, but I also wanted to avoid having Ciel be seen by other people in her current state of being only covered by just a piece of cloth.

「So that’s why we were looking for a robe.」
『If we couldn’t find one, we would’ve had no other choice but to borrow one from the dead, so I’m really glad.
     Still, as expected, there weren’t any that would fit Ciel’s size.』
「The dragging edges really look bad. Can I cut it to my size?」
『I see. Then please do so.』

I entrust Ciel to trim it to the right size with sorcery.
I can do as much as making water or cooling and heating drinks, but maybe since cutting counts as attacking, I can’t do it.
In contrast, Ciel focused on learning combat sorcery. Rather, she can generally do everything since she didn’t sacrifice her talent like I did. The only areas I can win against her are probably on defensive power and detection capability.

Since we would go searching for some later anyways, we searched for food supplies before returning to the giant.
Taking a closer look at it, the way it died was really unpleasant. There are holes boring through its body. However, since the wounds were cauterized by the flames, I can’t see any blood flowing out as well as inside of it; which makes staring at it more discomforting.
Particularly the head, the brain — though I’m not sure if there is one — is completely gouged out so I’m sure that it’s dead. However, it looks like it’s still alive, making it feel detached from reality.

The fact that I’m relatively fine with it may be either because of my reincarnation or because I’ve spent nearly 10 years in that kind of life.
Whichever it may be, it’s likely something I’ll need to survive in this world.
However, seeing someone die is still heart-wrenching, yet there might come a time in the future that I shouldn’t think of it that way. It’s not that I need to get used to death, but I need to be able to bear it at least.

As Ciel approached the giant, she went on her knees and thrust the knife into its body.
The knife had too many ornaments so I thought it was just for show, but it cut through the giant’s flesh much more smoothly than I anticipated.
Since it was already dead, there was no spouting blood and we immediately found an indigo blue orb that was a size bigger than a softball. This orb filled with pure and untouched magic power is probably the so called magic stone.

「Was this perhaps what you were looking for, Ain?」
『Since I can feel pure magic power from it, it most likely is. Might this be a magic stone?』
「So this is a magic stone. The books did say that it was taken from monsters.
     So you remembered that. That’s amazing!」

Seeing the actual object that she only knew from reading a book, Ciel got quite excited.
Among the books in that room were books with catalysts used in sorcery and magic, such as herbs and jewels, and how to acquire them. Still, maybe they thought that it wasn’t that important, as there weren’t really much of these books. That’s why it’s natural that Ciel didn’t remember them much.
I just remembered it from an assumption, so it’s not really that I’m amazing. Still, I don’t intend to tell Ciel about my past life yet, so I just accepted her praise with a strained smile.

『I believe that magic stones can be sold in many places and it might even help increase our magic power.
     So there’s really nothing to lose in bringing it along.』
「So that means that this really is that thing, right?」
『Yes, this seems to be one of the medicine’s main ingredients.』

Attentively reacting to my words, Ciel really is much more intelligent than me.
It looks like she’s really not just a duke’s daughter for show.
Moving on, they most likely didn’t just feed us raw magic stones. Still, that medicine was undoubtedly some processed form of a magic stone.

Magic power increases as you grow up, but it stops when you reach your mid-teens. There are some people that still continued increasing their magic power even after reaching adulthood. However, there should have been no established means of actively increasing one’s magic power.
I can’t really say that we’ve read all of them, but I’m positive that the books in that room all delved quite deep into the study of sorcery. We really need to adjust our common sense about sorcery when we reach the town or village as well.

「After this, I just need to burn and bury it…… right?」
『Yes, please feel free.』

Hearing my words, Ciel burns the giant, digs a hole and buries it.
All of these were done with sorcery, so Ciel herself didn’t get dirty and was able get it done in a few minutes.
As she leveled the filled ground flat, I noticed that Ciel was deeply thinking about something.

『Is there anything wrong?』
「Say, Ain. Is it possible that instead of using a knife, we could have just used sorcery to take out the magic stone?」
『Ah……』

Now that she said it, it’s true. Yeah, just the thought of dismantling a monster made me immediately think of using a knife; but Ciel’s sorcery is much more easy to use.

『B-But, still, we might need to use the knife in the future……
     No, um…… I’m really sorry that my hasty decision made us waste effort in finding it.』

I made up an excuse, but I hastily apologized before finishing so. Perhaps because of shame and embarrassment, my voice ended up gradually disappearing by the end of it.
If that continued on I might have gone defensive, but I want to be honest with Ciel as much as possible. Even if I am keeping my gender and past a secret.
Still, it doesn’t change that what I did was shameful. And just as I thought so, Ciel rapidly blinks her eyes in silence for some reason.

『Um……』
「It’s nothing, it is nothing, you see. It’s just that, I just thought a little, just a bit, that there really are things that even Ain doesn’t notice.
     Since Ain always helps me out, I thought that Ain can do anything.」
『Not really, there are probably more things I can’t do.』

While confused at the unusually talkative Ciel, I replied so.
Still, after seeing Ciel strangely delighted for some reason, I was relieved that I haven’t disappointed her.
But rather than just being delighted, is she perhaps grinning?

「Now then, what should we do now?
     Since all I’ve thought was how to escape the mansion, I’ve never really thought about what to do next, you know?」
『Since there is a road before us, let’s first try following it as far as we can.
     At the very least, we should reach some village or town.』

Advertisements
It’s a bit hard to call it a road, but since the grass is trampled on what are definitely a wagon’s tracks, I’m likely not mistaken.
At the very least, I think it’s more reliable than trying to find a river right now.

『Though there’s a limit to the food we can bring, we do have a few days’ worth and we can produce water with sorcery.
     Once we reach the town, that’s where the problem will likely be.』
「Problem?」
『Frankly speaking, Ciel is packed with traits that would get one into trouble.
     After all, Ciel’s a young girl, a disappointing princess, and a relative of the duke. Moreover, you look good too. It’s filled to the brim.』
「What does filled to the brim mean?」
『Umm, it means ‘too much’. It’s an idiom used back where I lived.』
「Fufufu. So I just need to not be a girl and also keep both the disappointing princess and the duke a secret, right?」

I’ve absolutely slipped up. To be tested just the next moment that I decided to be honest with her. It’s quite pathetic but as I can’t lie, please let me off.
Seeing her giggle delightedly, I’m not sure what Ciel is thinking. Still, since it seems that she knows that I don’t want her to probe me, I decided to follow her lead.

『I do think that your job and past can be kept hidden, but your appearance might be difficult to hide. Covering your hair is probably the most this robe can do.』
「I don’t really think there’s that much gender difference at my age, so can’t I disguise it?」
『If you cut your hair short and wear some over-sized clothes, I do think you would look androgynous. However, I don’t really recommend it.』
「Because my circuits run up to my hair, right? I don’t know how much cutting it would change my appearance, but certainly getting weaker is bad.」
『Moreover, if you absolutely need to show your Job for some reason, they’ll notice by the “Princess” part.』

If we live our life carefully, it’s probably possible to keep our jobs hidden. However, entering the town, for example, might require us to show our Jobs. And since we don’t have any that can be used for identification, all the more a problem.
Exactly because we’re ignorant of the world, it’s best that we think of every possibility.

『Also, if possible, once we reach a town, would you allow me to handle things for a while?』

Hearing my question, Ciel ponders deeply with a serious look.
In the future, I’d like Ciel to develop enough communication skills so that she would have the initiative. However, I think that it’s unreasonable to ask her to do so right now.
Rather, I think it’s amazing that she doesn’t even reject going to a human community right now.
After all, the only people she has met so far are the savage duke, the mask-faced butler, and the pig man + escorts. Even thinking optimistically, I think anyone would develop androphobia after that.
So until Ciel gets used to it, it’s probably best that I have the initiative for now.
「Ain, I’ll leave it to you.」Ciel gave in. It seems like she understood what I mean as well.

「There’s something I’ve been wondering about. Is there really any place we can work at?
     With our current money, we might be able to live on for a while, but it’ll run out eventually, right?」
『Regarding that, I do actually have a lead.
     I’m not absolutely sure about it, but since there are monsters everywhere, there’s an organization that should also exist. However, we’re going to get into a lot of trouble.』
「Is trouble, really a definite thing?」

Saying so with slight bewilderment, I replied『It’s a standard.』
