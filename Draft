「I see. Regarding Carol-san’s punishment, I’ll leave it to the Hunter’s Union. But please don’t let her off with no punishment.」
「Of course. Naturally.」
「And there’s something I want to confirm but, after what happened, what actually is the result of the match?」
「It’s your win.」

Carol-san immediately answered my question. I really like the way she’s fair and sincere but why does she have to be so reckless. No, maybe we were just coincidentally the type that incites recklessness in her behaviour.
After all, this likeable part of her might be the reason that Celia-san decided to let her handle the exam. In a way, she’s just unlucky but, as the party involved, I definitely don’t have any sympathy for her.

「Then that means I passed the B-Rank qualification exam, right?」
「It might take some time to get it approved, but there should be no problem. After all, you have proven to us that you have enough strength to meet the qualifications, Cielmer-san.」
「So then, please raise my hunter rank as high as possible. If possible, I want to be B-Rank and if I can’t, I want to at least be high enough that I won’t get treated badly in case I get into some trouble with high ranking hunters.」
「I’m very sorry. Regarding the the rank, there’s a limit to what we can do.
     However, as long as you are in this town, I can arrange it so that you can be certain to make achievements. I can’t be certain about it, but we will support you so that you reach C-Rank within a year.」
「How long does that usually take?」
「It’s typically said that it takes 5 years to reach D-Rank and 5 more years to reach C-Rank. Even capable people would likely take several years to get to C-Rank. Furthermore, since C-Rankers and above are recognized as Veteran Hunters, the guild’s treatment of them will change as well.
     However, just as C-Rankers and above are considered top hunters, it’s not a level that anybody can reach simply by trying.」

In that case, reaching C-Rank in a year might be quite big.

「Then from today’s incident, I would like to demand the guild for assistance until I reach C-Rank.
     Besides that, I would like to request only Celia-san to handle me on the reception desk. After all, I don’t think that the conversation will go just as smooth when talking to other people.」
「Understood. Then allow me to arrange that.」
「Also, if you know any inn I can stay in right now, please educate me.」
「Understood, let’s see. Since the sun is setting soon, allow me to guide you to an inn in the Hunter’s Guild’s referral. Do you have any requests?」

I was fine with just knowing the place but it seems that she’ll be guiding me too.
Well it’s not Japan after all, so it might be dangerous for a girl to walk at night by herself. Based on creative media for example, I might even encounter a kidnapper.
Since I’ll immediately notice if there are any suspicious movements, I don’t think we’ll be abducted though.
Most of all, even if I know how to go to the place, I might get lost as well. There isn’t a single reason for me to turn down this kindness of hers, is there?

「I would like a place that has a bath and is not very far from here.」
「Understood. Now then, we’ll talk about the exact details tomorrow; so for today, let me guide you to the inn.」
「Thank you very much.」

I don’t know if either she’s just being considerate of me, it’s part of the Hunter’s Guild’s regulations, or both; but since she’s going to take me to the inn, I’ll follow her.
At that moment, she told Carol-san「I’m not finished with you yet, so stay here.」and left the interrogation? room.

◇

Outside the Hunter’s Guild, it’s completely dark now but, from the windows of the surrounding buildings, light shines through.
It’s not a flickering light like those made by flames, and although it’s not as bright as that from a fluorescent bulb, it’s still probably bright enough for reading a book in the middle of the night.

「It’s really bright even though it’s nighttime.」
「Is this your first time seeing a lamp magic item?」
「Yes. I’m worried that I wouldn’t know how to use the one they have at the inn.」
「You only need to flip the switch, it’s not too complicated. And if the light doesn’t turn on, that means the magic stone has run out of magic power, so it’ll be fine if you tell the landlord about it.」

I mustered up my courage and asked about it but it seems that she didn’t find it that weird. In that case, magic items might not be available in small villages and such.
As I made a sigh of relief in my mind, with「If you don’t mind answering…」as a preface, Celia-san asked me a question.

「Why are you rushing to rank up?」
「Because I want to get out of this country?」
「Get out, is it?」
「Are you against me leaving this town?」

I asked a slightly involving question and carefully looked up to Celia-san. Since I was answering a question with another question, I was worried that Celia-san would find it offensive but it seems like it’s not a problem.
After shaking her head, she looks directly into my eyes and answered「I agree with that.」

「Cielmer-san, in my opinion, you’re an individual that shouldn’t be held back in a town like this.
     So regarding that, may I ask you why you want to get out of the country?」
「Celia-san, do you still remember how old you were, the first time you ate something?」
「Let’s see. I don’t really remember but I believe that children can generally start eating oatmeal half a year after their birth.」
「The first time I ate something, was when I was 5 years old.」

As I kept in mind to say it as casually as possible, Celia-san was left speechless and was unable to find anything to reply with.
I’m not really trying to brag about our misfortunes but since it looks like she might support us, I decided to talk a bit more about us.
「Celia-san, have you seen my hair?」
「…… Yes. I have. Since it seems that you want to keep it hidden, I did try not to stare too much.」
「At first, my hair was golden blond. Ever since it became white, I hide it like this but it looks like I don’t really need to hide it.」
「While it’s true that having white hair isn’t common to see, it’s not a color that you can’t find. A particular portion of sorcerers will even hold admiration simply because of having white hair.」
「Then it looks like I can let my hair out starting tomorrow.」
「That’s right. Doing so would also help quite a bit on our side.
     With that, even if I’m not there, it’ll make the reception much easier.」

This means that she can tell her co-workers to watch out for a white-haired 10-year-oldish girl.
In this sense, standing out isn’t always bad.
Since the mood got somewhat lighter, I asked her something that I was a bit curious about.

「By the way, about my match with Carol-san, is it really okay to see it as my win?
     We’ve already talked about it earlier, but I don’t really think that we finished the fight.」
「I would like to confirm, you can still fight right, Cielmer-san?」
「I can still probably take one more ice spear.」
「Since Carol doesn’t have enough energy left to use any proper sorcery, you would have most likely won if the fight continued on.
     That’s just how much magic power Glacia Lentso consumes.」
「After all, it doesn’t only pierce through, it also freezes the place it hits.」
「So you’ve notice that as well.」

It seems like the ice spear is something that’s extraordinary compared to other spells. Maybe that’s also why it had a proper name.
As I vaguely nodded, Celia-san stops in front of a certain building.
Seemingly familiar with the place, she enters the building with a brightly lit interior.

And as I followed her, it looks like Celia-san brought me to a place much prettier than I imagined. Having a calming light color as the main tone of the inn, I’m probably not mistaken to think that it’s a female-oriented inn.
At the counter there is a lady as well, that’s about old enough to have a child of my age. Her gentle smile and her height, slightly tall for a female, leaves a strong impression. So she seems to be an indulgent person in a lot of ways.

Since they seem to be close by how they’re talking, Celia-san might know her in private.
After talking for some time, Celia-san suddenly faces me.

「So with that, Nilda-san, please take care of Cielmer-san.」
「Sure sure. Cielmer-san, nice meeting you today.」
「Yes. Please take care of me.」

Nilda-san is looking at me with a friendly smile but I wonder what she sees me as.
Does she think of me as a country bumpkin that came from a declining village? I should’ve listened to their conversation.
Nilda-san takes out a key and gives it to me while saying「You’re probably tired for today, so I’ll have dinner brought to your room. Your room is in the innermost area of the 2nd floor. It’s a bit far but do your best.」
After receiving the key and thanking her, I did as she said and went up to the 2nd floor.
I enter the room that fits my key and decide to rest while waiting for the food to arrive.

Today was somehow awfully tiring.
