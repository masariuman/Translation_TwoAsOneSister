『Before we switch, would you mind if I sing for a while?』
『Not at all, but why?』
『I want to have as many monsters possible to come to us. There shouldn’t be any people within hearing range, so I thought that if we could lead the flow of monsters towards us, the others should follow behind.』
『Understood. I’ll leave the timing of the switch to Ain.』

From the edge of the forest, we’re now slightly near the town. The swarm of monsters should arrive in a few minutes, but Ciel and I continue talking like we always do.
Since we absolutely can’t let anyone know that I’m a Song Princess, I thoroughly checked with detection before singing a la~la~la~, making even the monsters straying from the swarm turn their feet towards us.
After that, the drug’s effect should handle everything else. I switched with Ciel and left the rest to her.

「Ain. Doesn’t it feel a bit hot today?」
『Does it? …… No, that’s right. Then, should I sing something with a cool and refreshing feel?』
「We might be staying here for a long time, but……. There’s no need to worry about that, is there?」

Ciel let out a giggle. Even if it’ll take us a few hours as she expects, my repertoire should have enough to last.
If I don’t limit the songs, I can go for a whole day, and more importantly, there’s nothing stopping me from looping songs.
Among them, I decided to sing a song related to water first.
Though I have no idea what a refreshing tone would be, I began singing while imagining something with a cool feel.

At that moment, the leading pack of monsters came within sight.
The first to arrive are the fast-footed wolves and the goblins and kobolds from the shallow parts.
Even though we’re already at a visible distance, they’re not looking at Ciel at all, likely since they were attracted by the scent.

Seemingly crazed, the monsters stared at the empty air as they headed towards our direction. But then, they were suddenly engulfed in water.
The only action that Ciel took was elegantly raising and lowering her arms, but matching her movements, a pillar of water twice her size rose from the ground and collapsed into a tidal wave, swooping down on the monsters.

While seeing several monsters being washed away was quite the sight, the true purpose for doing this was to flood the ground.
Though the water on the ground only reaches Ciel’s ankles, it was enough to trip the feet of the monsters.
The wolves lost their mobility and the goblins were slowed to a snail’s pace.

Setting up this stage, Ciel stands on top of the water like a water sprite.
We already have music and dance, so thinking that we should be able to set our own stage, Ciel created—discovered—this one Dance Princess ability. I call it Deagua Elicinary, the Stage of Water, I guess.
Well, it’s just a temporary name used to refer to it during discussions. In the first place, it’s not clear whether this is made using Dance Princess or sorcery, and because it doesn’t have as much power as Glacio Lentso, it isn’t particularly a spell name. It’s simply something used to set the stage.

All of this water is used as Ciel dances. As proof of that, the water on the ground is absolutely clear. It would get muddy if Ciel wants it to, but I guess this time, she wants to make use of this clarity.
As Ciel twirls, the crystal-clear water coils around her, rising like a serpent.
As she waves her arms, trails of water trace its path.
And as she takes a step, waves ripple out.

Matching my song, Ciel dances. Matching her dance, the water flutters.
And to tell the truth, she can glide around the surface of the water as well, but it seems like she won’t be doing that today.

In front of us, the monsters charge straight towards Ciel.
To dance is to fascinate and impress. Because of that, anything that sees Ciel dancing won’t be able to take their eyes off of her.
In game-like terms, when Ciel uses her full power as a Dance Princess, she attracts the enemy’s aggro.
Therefore, as long as the course of the stampede is set our way, the monsters will run towards Ciel on their own volition.

And so they were then knocked away by the whip-like water extending around Ciel. Engulfed by the waves. Flattened by the weight of water. The monsters were drowned, hurled, and crushed, bringing their lives to a close. Her refined dance created this disproportionally disastrous scene.

As we roughly got rid of all the E-class monsters, the D-class monsters began increasing in number.
The orc and boar-type monsters are highly durable, so perhaps because it took a bit more time to defeat them, Ciel’s combat pattern slightly changed.
I then sung a song about the cold of winter, adding ice to her attacks.

As Ciel hops, steps, and raises her foot, the splashes of water in the air turn into arrows of ice, raining down a barrage that the monsters of this class have no chance of dodging.
While each one may seem small, being filled with abundant magic power, the arrows are sharp and rigid enough to pierce through.
The rain of ice was promptly dyed into a rain of blood.

While the monsters’ shrieks resounded, those arrived.

Having eight red eyes and sickle-like jaws. Eight legs extending from their bristled body, four on each side.
What was practically our natural enemies were instantly burnt to nothing upon entering Ciel’s field of vision.
With the full use of all 100% of the Dance Princess’ power, in addition to having the Song Princess’ support, not a trace of them was left behind. Just this time, they were immediately disposed of, regardless of the abrupt change the flow.

It was frankly overkill but seeing the tinge of discomfort in Ciel’s face, it was inevitable. Rather, even I wanted those to perish immediately.
After all, with there being dozens of spiders, it’s a spot-on trigger for our trauma. Holding back wasn’t possible from the start.
There’s risk of burning the trees if Ciel uses too much firepower but it should be fine with the surrounding area being flooded out.

◇

Probably about five songs have passed, roughly around 20 minutes. Singing is fun, but when I have too much fun, I forget how many songs I already sang.
Except for when the spiders came, Ciel seems to be having fun dancing the whole time, so it’s probably similar for her too.
Though while she is having fun, her dance itself and the look on her face is looking pretty sharp.

C-class monsters then finally appeared, and thinking about it now, it’s our first time seeing any of them.
One having two horns, tough red skin, and being more than twice Ciel’s height, the ogre.
Another having grey skin, a swollen stomach, a bald head, and a large club on its hand, the troll.
From what I can see, the only C-class here are either one of these two. And judging from the presences, I should be right.

They’re clearly much bigger than the monsters up until now, and even after they stepped into Ciel’s stage, they charged on with nearly no signs of being affected by it.
Even after hitting them with whips of water, even after smacking them with spheres of water, even with the rippling waves and the soaring arrows, it all seemed like wasted effort, all were ignored still.

『How troubling.』
『You don’t sound that troubled considering that, Ciel.』
『Fufu, I was joking. Shall we freeze them then?』
『Understood. By the way, are you still good on magic power?』
『I… might have played around a little too much, but this much is alright.』

We stopped performing for just a short while and had a conversation.
After using this power on such a large scale, even Ciel should be cutting it close on magic power, or so I thought, but that doesn’t seem to be the case at all. At the very least, she should be able to last until the end of the stampede.
In contrast, since I’m only singing, my magic power consumption is nearly zero.

Battle restart. In total, the ogres and trolls together number about less than a hundred. All of them have entered Ciel’s stage and the ones at the forefront brandished their clubs as they were now only a few steps away from her. While the sight would have probably left a considerable impact on others, since we’ve already seen the higher-class cyclops attack us right before our eyes, it doesn’t scare me at all.
Besides, unfortunately for them, before they can even reach Ciel, she already finished tapping her toes twice on the surface of the water.

This time, like a flowing ripple, ice began blanketing the water.
Naturally, the monsters’ feet got frozen as well, causing several of the running monsters to fall crashing to the ground. And after that, the ones behind them fell too, and then the next, and so on, giving a show of a literal stampede.
However, as expected of a monster’s vitality I suppose, none of them died then.
Although it seems like Ciel anticipated that, or maybe she just wanted to dance in this unique environment, as she began gliding around the surface of the ice.

In other words, she was skating on ice. While it can be said that figure skating is a form of dance, this time, Ciel’s neither doing any jumps nor spins.
While gliding her way through the gaps between the monsters, she creates needles of ice under the soles of her feet and proceeds to exterminate them all. Among them, there were some that didn’t trip, but it doesn’t change the fact that they can’t move. Swinging her arm down in a polished motion, ice crushes their heads.
The spout of blood freezes before even reaching Ciel.

From now on, it’s routine work, or rather, just for our amusement. Until Ciel is satisfied, I only have to sing.
After all, in just doing that, the monsters die on their own.
◇

As I finished one last song, with there being no signs of living monsters left, Ciel stopped dancing as well.
She struck a pose like those at the end of a figure skating performance, but since it’s not like she’s giving a show to anyone, Ciel immediately went back her usual form.
While she’s breathing heavily with her shoulders bobbing up and down, the look on her face is saying that she still hasn’t danced enough and it’s adorable.

Now then, we’ve somehow handled the stampede, but there’s still a problem.
After all, there were two presences that came from the town and one of them went back. In other words, there’s one left. I would’ve preferred if both of them just went back together though. We were being watched ever since the ice part, but given that no Dance Princess can exhibit power at this scale on their own, it’ll probably be perceived as a large-scale sorcery or something similar…… Usually, that is.

「That’s awful of you to be peeping, Carol-san.」
「After having so much fun dancing, why the bad mood all of a sudden?」
「Somebody barged in while I was enjoying myself, so I can’t help it.」

Casually turning around, I see Carol-san just taken aback as she stares at me.
We’ve settled a whole stampede on our own, you know? While there’s a reason to show gratitude, there’s not a reason to react like that! Just kidding.

「For now, you aren’t rude enough to ask for an explanation, right?」
「Well of course. After everything that just happened. Besides, I’m not so terrible of a hunter to demand an explanation here.」
「But you’re curious, aren’t you? About my Job.」
「That’s…… your fault for telling me about the connection of sorcery and Jobs, isn’t it?」

Carol-san looking away all pouty was so amusing, I almost broke into a laugh.
While that only ended up making her much grumpier, it seems like the lingering enjoyment from earlier made me a bit more talkative.
Still, I have no intention of relaying everything while we’re still in this country.

「Let’s see. The Job I told you then wasn’t a lie.
That’s all I can say for now.」
「Right. I’ll think about that later.」
「By the way, about these monsters, should I dismantle every single one of them?
Retrieving the evidence parts, magic stones, and so is going to be bothersome, though.」
「That’ll depend on you. If there are materials and magic stones you want, then take them.
If you don’t want anything, then request the guild to deal with this disaster. After that, you’ll be handed the rewards for resolving the stampede and 70% of the materials’ buyout sum.」

I was wondering why it was only 70%, but I suppose the remaining 30% will go to the guild’s intermediation fee and the reward for the hunter accepting the request. It’s definitely much better than doing it ourselves.
With that said, it should be fine to just take the magic stones of C-class monsters that had particularly strong reactions from detection.

『Ciel, do you have any materials you want?』
『Materials? Even if you ask me that Ain, I have no idea on how to use it.
Would horns and such turn into weapons? Fur into armor? Even so, I wouldn’t need those, correct?』
『Right, you wouldn’t. It’s not like we can make the pills anyway, but the magic stones might be useful for something, so I think it should be fine to take only those.』
『I see. Ain, could you choose which ones would be good?』

「In that case, I’ll retrieve just a few magic stones.」
「Sure, take your time.」
I switched with Ciel, chose 10 out of the monsters frozen at their feet, and had Ciel get their magic stones.
Come to think of it, Carol-san called it a “disaster” but isn’t that awful of her?
Well, people not used to the sight of crushed monster heads and exposed organs would probably vomit though.

Ciel swiftly retrieves the magic stones with sorcery, and after cleaning them with water, she crams them into our purse-use magic bag.
It’s really convenient. If we had a much bigger magic bag, would we be able to bring all these monsters along?

「I’ve had a quick look but, were there giant spiders-……」
「There were absolutely none of those sort.」
「Could you answer me seriously? It’ll affect how we should cope for the future.」
「Anyhow, every single one that headed this way was turned to ash. Their magic stones should be rolling around the ground somewhere, I think.」
「Right. Understood.」

Disregarding how I feel about them, having only one specific kind of monster surviving would probably be an issue in and of itself.
It might become a higher-order species. Or rather, do monsters of this world evolve or transform and stuff?

「I have a question, I know that there are monsters that have higher-order species, subspecies and so on, but do existing species suddenly change too?」
「Come to think of it, we haven’t talked about evolution, haven’t we?
It’s been confirmed that long living monsters turn into higher-order species. Though with that said, there aren’t any differences between monsters born as high-order species and one that evolved into one.」
「So that’s why you asked about the spiders, right?」
「It’ll be annoying if one becomes a higher-order after all. Besides, a lot of monsters become more intelligent after evolving to a higher-order, and there are cases where that triggers a stampede.」

It seems like there was a time when a higher-order species was born, gathered monsters of the same lineage, increased their numbers, and descended to a village.
It can be said that hunters are decreasing the numbers so that this doesn’t occur.
While we’re at it, I asked about how monsters multiply as well, and it seems like they can either just appear out of thin air or are born from eggs and live birth. In regards to the spontaneously appearing ones, there isn’t much known about them.

On the way back, while chatting with Carol-san, I suddenly realised something important.

「Now that I think about it, this incident will be added to my achievements, right? 」
「It will. Another person and I verified it, so this’ll definitely be your achievement.」
「I can be C-rank, right? 」
「Since you resolved a stampede with several dozens of C-class monsters in it, it wouldn’t be strange even if you become a top ranking C-rank from the get go. And while we’re at it, since you’ve already passed the test, it still wouldn’t be strange for you to reach B-rank now, but it’ll be tough considering your age.」
「It can’t be helped then.」

For now, getting to be C-rank should be good enough.

「So then what caused today’s stampede?」
「I only came here to see if there really is a stampede, so who knows?
Rather, what about you? Do you know something?」
「I found a oddly colored, sweet scented liquid.」
「It was sickeningly sweet, wasn’t it?」
「That’s how it felt to me, but a party that I was with by chance didn’t seem to feel the same.
Rather, one of them didn’t even smell anything at all.」
「…… Well that practically settles it then.」
「As I thought, the scent would feel different depending on the amount of magic power one has, right? 」
「Exactly. And since monsters have magic stones by nature, you can say that they naturally have magic power.
Being drawn in to by the scent is already enough and all, but the annoying thing is that the higher the class of the monster, the stronger they get drawn to it.」

Letting out a deep sigh, Carol-san then asked me.

「And the drug?」
「After covering it, I asked the party together with me to bring it to town.」
「In that case then, things should be all settled by the time we return.
Although at worst, we might arrive in the middle of an uproar.」
「That sounds immeasurably bothersome.」

I have a hunch that the blame would be put on me after all.
Keeping that only in my thoughts, I decided to end our discussion about this incident.
