「So with that said, in using sorcery, control is always important and the foundation for that control is magic power circulation.」
「Yes, but you can’t use powerful sorcery with just magic power circulation.」
「To begin with, in the case of water attribute sorcery, there are only a few spells specialised for combat.
Besides, having a good circulation will increase your circuit’s total magic power, allowing the use of powerful sorcery. Naturally, magic power circulation isn’t everything, but when two people use the same spells, the one that has better control would be stronger.」

As I was teaching Perla-san, one of the members of the three person party I was told to work with next, Carol-san mutters「You teach surprisingly well.」in praise.
Since Carol-san is with us, she really should be the one teaching. It’s making me feel like a child on parents’ day, it’s awfully uncomfortable.
As for why I’m teaching Perla-san sorcery in the first place, it’s because she said that she doesn’t want to join since, with a D-rank hunter, she’ll just weigh everyone down.
With that being the case, after the ice witch’s coaxing「Can’t you just teach her then?」and the sweet words of “Advantage for Promotion”, I gave in and taught her before we would formally act together as a party.

Somehow, whenever the term ”promotion” comes out, it feels like I always do everything that I’m told to do.
Rather, Ciel already said『Ain has a habit of nodding whenever promotions get involved, don’t you?』and pointed it out. Upon hearing that, I was left speechless. Still, it didn’t particularly sound like Ciel was against it.
Though we are having lessons, I can’t use combat sorcery after all, so I’m teaching her while having Ciel’s advice.

Changing the topic, when I first met with the party, they were surprisingly welcoming.
They were respectful from the start, although a part of it seems to be because Carol-san told them that I was the one that actually helped them before and due to me having been in a party with Brass-kun like them.
They then apologised about what happened with him. It seems that they were friends from the same village. After receiving his Job, Brass-kun started to get smug, and set himself a course directly towards the stratosphere.

「What is your usual role, Perla-san?」
「Umm, when outside of combat, I make drinking water and wash off the splashes of blood. During a fight, I shoot out water balls but it’s only enough to stop monsters from moving, I can’t defeat them. I can’t use ice sorcery too, I’m just a burden.」

Setting aside the now depressed Perla-san, I ponder for a bit.
Based on what I saw before, they fight with Terencio-kun keeping the enemies in check using his one-handed sword while Perla-san and the archer Ilda attack from the backline. In the sense of keeping the two girls away from danger, what they’re doing might be correct but, in this case, I guess Perla-san certainly does bring little help.
After all, even when attacking from the rear, she still lacks lethal force. I can’t be sure but Terecio-kun probably kills more while he’s keeping the enemies away.

Besides, she’s a Lesser Sorcerer and a commoner, generally said to have practically no magic power by nature.
What she can do is limited. But still, she should be able to at least push away an enemy by making a large amount of water but, if she does, she’ll likely run out of magic power after one shot and be out for the fight.
In the first place, she’s already doing her part well outside combat in my opinion, but I’m guessing that Brass-kun might have forced his “Great hunters” equals “The guy who beats stronger monsters” type of mentality on them.

「When sorcerers fight, what do you think is important?」
「High offensive power….. and…… control over sorcery?」
「In my opinion, it’s to observe.」

While it’s good that she remembered our discussion about control, I think that awareness is important for sorcerers.
This isn’t really limited to sorcerers but the rear guard in particular should have a whole picture of what’s happening. Especially in the case of individuals acting solo. If they don’t observe their surroundings, they could just drop dead.

「I generally act alone, so I don’t know much about how to act in a party but no matter how strong your spell is, it would be useless if you hit your allies, isn’t it?
To make sure that doesn’t happen, you should consider where your allies are, where the enemies are concentrated at, and where it would be good to release your spell.」
「So to be aware of that, I should observe, right?」
「If people can do it after simply being told to, it wouldn’t be considered a difficult thing.
However, if it’s only about stopping and disrupting an enemy, powerful and complicated spells are unnecessary.
After all, just making a puddle by an opponent’s feet should be enough to obstruct their movements and just hitting their eyes with a splash of water should be enough to make them open to attacks. To perform these skillfully, observing is really important.」
「So in other words, I should be focusing completely on support?」
「Yes. In my opinion, doing so should be more practical. Still, I’m sure that your party has your way of doing things, so please discuss it together with them. Even if you change your methods, it wouldn’t go well immediately after all.」

With our lesson ending here, I announced「That will be all.」as I clapped my hands twice.
I wouldn’t call classroom lectures useless, rather lectures are probably the main way of learning with sorcery, but Perla-san still hasn’t reached the point of needing it yet. Since it should be better for her to have practical training with her fundamentals without thinking about the complicated stuff, lesson finished.

Perla-san lowered her head, gave her thanks, and left the booth provided for us.
It’s hard to describe, but I believe that someone who’s completely self-taught really shouldn’t be teaching.
Without any clear idea of what I was doing, I learned detection and barrier sorcery, how to conceal it, minimised the energy consumption, and I’m not even sure if it’s still sorcery or actual magic.
On the other hand, I think Ciel has a completely orthodox way of learning. However, her fundamentals come from the Respelgia family’s bookshelves, so they might be pretty unconventional. The part where magic power resides on the soul is already different from the general perception after all.

「Was that really enough?」
「The basics are important. Even more so if you originally couldn’t use sorcery.」
「Well, good enough. You haven’t said anything wrong after all.
Incidentally, could you teach me something too?」
「Why should I have to teach you?」
「Is there anything you’d like?」
「I want B-rank hunter qualifications.」
「Could you make it something possible for me? Celia’s in charge of those sorts of things.」
「Then a magic bag please. A small one is enough.」
「Oh, so you’re good with that, I see. How about this one then?」

After making a surprised look, she took out a generally small sized pouch, which is slightly bigger than Ciel’s hand, and placed it on top of the table.
It’s scary how smooth this conversation is going, but if I can get it then I really want to have it.

「Magic bags are expensive, right?」
「Well, they are. But this one isn’t expensive.
This was made by an acquaintance item crafter’s apprentice for practice. It’s practically worth nothing, but since you can only get one if you know an item crafter, I suppose it would be quite difficult to come by.」
「This, how much can it hold?」
「About as much as a hunter’s typical shoulder bag. If you’re using in exchange of a purse, there shouldn’t be any problems, right?」
「I already think it’s too much, but if you’re giving it away then I’ll have it after we’re done.」

With the negotiation complete, time to think of what I should talk about.
Since I’m getting something I want, if possible, I want to give Carol-san information she’d like as well.
Rather, because Carol-san likes doing research, she would probably be much happier if I give her some material she can research on.
In that case, since Perla-san was here earlier as well, maybe I should talk about Jobs and magic power. Besides, there’s something I’m curious about.

「Before we discuss, I want to confirm something about the general perception. Carol-san, do you know where magic power comes from?」
「…… Just from this preface, I already feel like this is going to break the sorcery community.
Well, anyway, what’s typically said is that magic power flows from the heart. However, since there are people that have it slightly off where the heart is, the latest theory is that it’s from something controlling magic power somewhere inside the body.」

As I thought, that is what’s considered to be common knowledge.
If it wasn’t, then the information I’m about to say would be worthless and I wouldn’t get the magic bag, so this is good.

「About that, the truth is that it comes from the soul.」
「You sound awfully confident saying that. Normally no one would believe it if you say something that absurd, you know?」
「I’d say that both you and I probably aren’t a part of that “normal” though.
And about why I’m so confident about it, all I can say is that I had that kind of experience myself.」
「I won’t ask you what kind of experience it was. I have a feeling that, if I do, I’d end up having more work to do.
However, I do know that aren’t lying. At the very least, there’s no need for you to tell such a useless lie.」
「Though, if I really hated you so much, I could probably make up a lie or two. After all, it would probably steal so much of your time. 」
「If after telling me this much, what you said actually wasn’t true, I’d be at awe.」

Saying so, Carol-san’s eyes sparkle with excitement.
From my perspective, since a person can still normally use sorcery even if the magic power comes from the wrong place, I don’t really think that this would have a considerable impact. Well, sure, I’m aware that it will have a considerable impact, but from where our conversation is right now, it wouldn’t really seem that way.

「Oh. In spite of experiencing this breakthrough yourself, you don’t really have much of a reaction.」
「Well, from where I left off, it’s not as if anything would particularly change after all.
Is it really something to be that excited about?」
「What are you talking about? As long as you know where magic power comes from, it might be possible to draw out more magic power, you know?
In that sense, it’ll be at least a direct increase in firepower.」

I was overwhelmed by Carol-san’s excitement.
While it’s true that it should lead to an increase in firepower, or rather output, since I already discovered it pretty early, I don’t really feel the effects myself.
Nonetheless, if Carol-san’s happy about it, then great. Now we can have the magic bag without any weight on my conscience.
Still, I’m a bit worried about Carol-san’s pure excitement.

「I’m glad that you look happy about it but please keep in mind that this information originated from an individual that brought forth a being like me.」
「That’s right.」

Seeing Carol-san turn calm in an instant is a bit scary.
Really, why didn’t she have this composure during our formal match?

「Actually, was it alright to tell me about this?」
「There’s already a noble that knows about this. Even if I didn’t tell you, someone else might discover and spread this information one day. While we’re at it, you might even discover it yourself.
So in this case, wouldn’t it be much safer that I taught and warned you about it?」
「That might be true. At the very least, I’d think of being careful about it.」
「Besides, in the event that we’ll be up against the said noble, the knowledge of the information could affect the tide of battle.」
「So you’re thinking that this might be a possibility.」
「Who knows? I was just being imprisoned after all.
While I’m somewhat aware of what methods he was using to accomplish his objective, I have no idea of what that objective is.
However, it’s an individual that would lock up an infant for 10 years for his objective and sell her when she’s unneeded after all.」

He’s probably done some other nonsense besides what he did to us but judging from the rumors, there’s nothing on him. At the pub, I’ve only asked about relatively surface-level topics so that people wouldn’t think that I’m investigating the Respelgia household. Still, people just randomly talk about the really awful nobles without me asking anyway. Thanks to that, I’ve already decided on which route to use to reach the ocean after leaving this town.

Carol-san said「I’ll bear it in mind.」as she earnestly nodded, so it would probably be bad if I don’t tell her this as well.

「Come to think of it, I’ve been lecturing Perla-san just some time ago but don’t you think that she’s quite an interesting individual?」
「…… Wait, by magic power comes from the soul, that’s what you mean?」

Just by saying Perla-san’s name, Carol-san was shaken up. She really is quick on her head.
And based on the anxious tone of her voice, she likely felt that the relationship of Jobs and magic power is a dangerous one.

「From my experience, the two of them are different. However, I can’t say that they have absolutely no influence on each other.」
「I see, you’re right. A cheap magic bag won’t be enough for this information.
Are there any other things you’d like?」
「In that case, please keep our conversation a secret and the research that you’ll start based on this discussion to yourself.
At least, while I’m still in this country.」
「That goes without saying. There’s no way I can publish this.」
「Then will you still do a study on this?」
「It’s not like I’m doing sorcery research to particularly stand out after all.
I’m doing it because it’s fun. I have tons of other private studies besides this one. 」
「In that case, I don’t mind if it’s after I leave this country, please tell me about the results in the future.
I just turned 10 recently, I don’t have a good grasp on my Job in the first place.」

In regards to our Jobs, Ciel probably has better control over hers compared to me.
But if I can master it, I should be able to power myself up more. Still, how many years after would that even be?

「Oh, that’s right. When we discuss things, it really makes me forget about the concept of age.
Once you reach B-rank, call me at the headquarters. I’ll invite you to my house. By then, my work in this country should be done as well.」
「When the time comes, please take care of me. Well then.」

So that I won’t forget it today, I made sure to carry the magic bag before I exited the room.
