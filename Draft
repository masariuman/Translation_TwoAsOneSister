That day, I rode a late-night bus back to my parents’ house.

It would have been nice if I could sleep until my stop, but I wasn’t really used to doing so. So even in the dark, I couldn’t quite sleep and I think I was just blankly staring at space at that time.

Because of that, I remember it.

The sudden floating sensation, the unbearable impact.

The feeling of pain that made it bothersome to even lift a finger. The pained groaning all around me.

I thought to myself then, ‘If only that last thing I heard was the sound of someone singing…’ and that moment, I died.

◇◇◇

However, just when I thought I was dead, for some reason, I woke up.

And suddenly, it was just cold. The air itself feels cold, everything that touched me felt just as cold, even the clanking sound I hear was cold. Everything my senses feel is only the absolute cold.

And even though I was in this situation, I couldn’t make a sound, my body doesn’t move, and even my eyes can’t see a thing.

Am I blindfolded and tied up to something?

Even so, I should be able to move my fingers.

I’m sure that I should be able to move my head and raise my voice. And yet, I can definitely feel my body, but I can’t move anything.

I definitely should have died, so is this hell?

Will I be tortured like this, unable to do anything, forever? Will my body be burned, chipped, and ripped apart with my senses intact?

The more I think about it, the more my mind comes up with horrible answers. And even though my body should be shivering, even though my heart should be racing, even though I should be at least breaking out cold sweat; the fact that none of these are happening was just absolutely terrifying for me.

I wonder how much time has passed since?

Nothing ever happened from then, so I managed to calm down a bit.

Though I can’t see a thing nor even move a finger, since I still have my senses, I tried getting a grasp of my current situation. And just as I thought of doing so, my vision suddenly cleared up.
